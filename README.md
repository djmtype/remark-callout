**This plugin is being developed.**

# To do list

- [ ] to markdown extension of callout.
- [ ] write a css file to import.

This is a remark plugin that adds obsidian-like callout syntax.
Note that this is *not* a transformer plugin. Instead,
under the hood it adds syntax extensions to micromark, which is the markdown parser used in remark-parse.

Issues and pull requests are welcomed.
